## Abstract

In this paper, we present our approach for the ’Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News
Articles’ task as a part of the 2020 edition of International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation.
The specific objective of this task is to identify and extract the text segments in which propaganda
techniques are used. We propose a multi-system deep learning framework that can be used to
identify the presence of propaganda spans in a news article and also deep dive into the diverse
enhancements of BERT architecture which are part of the final solution. Our proposed final model
gave an F1-score of 0.48 on the test dataset.
